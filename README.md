# UPDATE V3
What is this new and all of a sudden update for? Well, for personal reasons, (and mostly legal) I have decided to **delete**, yes I mean **delete** the proxy tab. Trust me, this is for a good reason. Otherwise, this website wouldn't exist anymore. To make things up, I decided to add more entertainment to the website, (More games, websites, etc.) And I even added a suggestion box! So if you have any suggestions on the website, than submit the form that's inside the tab.
